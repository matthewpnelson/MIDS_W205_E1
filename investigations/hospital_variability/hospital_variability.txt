-- Hospital Variability SQL query

-- Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?

-- Tables to use: procedures_detail, hospital_edit

-- Selection Criteria:
-- Grouping by Procedure, we want to see the highest variability in scores across 
-- hospitals (there is only one score per procedure per hospital so we do not need to 
-- aggregate at the hospital level first).

-- Results were secondarily ordered by Avg_Score, to bring to the top the procedures which
-- have some very high performers but the majority of hospitals struggle with. This highlights
-- procedures which could be the focus for additional training to increase average scores.

-- Scores relating to the emergency department were excluded from aggregation, as they went beyond the standard 0-100
-- scale. 

-- Focusing on only procedure care scores, not readmission scores as these are difficult 
-- to compare to one another because high procedure care scores are good while low 
-- readmissions scores (score / denominator) are good. A multi-filter could have occured
-- between these two metrics, however it was decided not to pursue this for this assignment.

-- Had to convert all of our number columns to INT before aggregating, used the cast() function.

The procedures which display a high variability in terms of care scores amoungst all hospitals are:
OP_20
ED_2b
OP_23
STK_4
VTE_5
VTE_1
STK_8
IMM_2
HF_1 
STK_1 
, sorted by variability and then secondarily by average score.

If the selection criteria for # of results were increased to 50, we would see a quick dropoff in variance from 100 for the top 
group of procedures quickly down below 20 suggesting that there are only a small number of procedures that experience very 
high variability in the quality of performance. 

In a large group of hospitals performing a single procedure there could, by chance, be one poor performer which increases the variance 
between max and min for that procedure, despite the overall average score for that procedure remaining high.
