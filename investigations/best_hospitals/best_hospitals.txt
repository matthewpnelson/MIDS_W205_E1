-- Best Hospitals SQL query

-- What hospitals are models of high-quality care? That is, which hospitals have the most consistently high scores for a variety of procedures.

-- Tables to use: procedures_detail, hospital_edit, survey_averages_edit

-- Selection Criteria:
-- Grouping by Hospital, we want to see the highest average scores across all of their procedures.

-- Also want to consider how many procedures they do, as a hospital could be very good at a small
-- number of procedures by way of specialty. We are more interested in general excellence.

-- An additional constraint is applied to keep the total variance between max and min scores
-- to be below 20, as a very high average score doesn't mean consistency if there is at least one
-- procedure that has been performed poorly at the hospital. 

-- Scores relating to the emergency department were excluded from aggregation, as they went beyond the standard 0-100
-- scale. 

-- Focusing on only procedure care scores, not readmission scores as these are difficult 
-- to compare to one another because high procedure care scores are good while low 
-- readmissions scores (score / denominator) are good. A multi-filter could have occured
-- between these two metrics, however it was decided not to pursue this for this assignment.

-- Had to convert all of our number columns to INT before aggregating, used the cast() function.

The hospitals which display a consistently high quality of care amoungst all their procedures are:
BAYLOR HEART AND VASCULAR HOSPITAL
TEMPLE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL
DEBORAH HEART AND LUNG CENTER
TEXAS HEALTH HEART & VASCULAR HOSPITAL ARLINGTON
KAISER FOUNDATION HOSPITAL - BALDWIN PARK
FRANCISCAN HEALTHCARE - MUNSTER
THE HEART HOSPITAL AT DEACONESS GATEWAY LLC
FRESNO HEART AND SURGICAL HOSPITAL

, sorted by average score.

If the selection criteria for consistency were set any tighter, say to a maximum variance of less than 15 points instead of 20
we would see a list smaller than 10 hospitals suggesting that the list above is a good representation for high quality care.
