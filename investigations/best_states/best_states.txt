-- Best States SQL query

-- What states are models of high-quality care?

-- Tables to use: procedures_detail, hospital_edit

-- Selection Criteria:

-- Grouping by State, we want to see the highest average scores across all of their procedures
-- from every hospital within that state. Not just the average of all hospitals!

-- The number of different procedures for each state isn't as valuable of a metric at the state level
-- simply due to population density and funding that may not be available for complex procedures in that state.
-- This constraint was not included. 

-- An additional constraint on total score variance was not used here, as in the majority of states
-- the variance appears to be near 100, suggesting there is at least one hospital with very poor ratings
-- in that state, despite the high overall average we are seeing. 

-- Scores relating to the emergency department were excluded from aggregation, as they went beyond the standard 0-100
-- scale. 

-- Focusing on only procedure care scores, not readmission scores as these are difficult 
-- to compare to one another because high procedure care scores are good while low 
-- readmissions scores (score / denominator) are good. A multi-filter could have occured
-- between these two metrics, however it was decided not to pursue this for this assignment.

-- Had to convert all of our number columns to INT before aggregating, used the cast() function.

The states which display a consistently high quality of care amoungst all their procedures in all hospitals are:
DE, PR, NH, NJ, HI, FL, VT, ME, CA, CT
, sorted by average score.

To note, the procedure counts for Delaware and Vermont are substantially lower than some of the other top performing states, however the 
counts of hospitals of 140&184 suggests a large enough sample size for the central limit theorem to apply, allowing scores to 
regress to the true mean and providing confidence in the overall state average.
